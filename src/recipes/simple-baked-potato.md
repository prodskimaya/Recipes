### Requisite Items
 - A potato
 - Olive oil
 - Salt
 - Small pot
 - Aluminum foil

### Instructions
 1. Prepare the small pot by covering the inside with aluminum foil. Pre-heat the oven to 400Â°F.

 2. Wash and thoroughly scrub the potato to remove all dirt and debris (WITHOUT SOAP).

 3. Proceed to poke small holes all over the outside of the potato. They don't need to be deep. This is done so steam can escape, so the potato won't explode.

 4. Put the potato inside the small pot that was prepared early, then lather it with olive oil. The potato should be glossy.

 5. Sprinkle a decent amount of salt---as much salt as you think you'll need---on all sides of the potato.

 6. Put the potato in the oven for one hour. Don't worry to much about the time to cook, as it's difficult to overcook a baked potato.
